Product Listings: Sections displaying various products with images, prices, and descriptions, arranged in a grid or list format similar to Amazon's product catalog.

Product Details Page: Individual product pages that show detailed information about each item, including images, specifications, pricing, and customer reviews.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the site is mobile-friendly, using CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes and devices.
